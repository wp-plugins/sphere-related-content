The Sphere Related Content plug-in displays an icon link at the end of your blog posts. When a reader clicks on the icon link, we find blog and media articles related to your blog posts. See it in action on over 1 billion article pages on popular blogs and media sites like the New York Times and GigaOm.  The Sphere Related Content plug-in works best on topics that are being actively discussed in the blogosphere and news media. If you're one of those truly eccentric bloggers, well, proceed with caution :)

== Installation ==

1. Copy the file sphere-related-content.php into your plugins directory (wp-content/plugins/).

2. Login to your WordPress Admin Panel 

3. Go to the Plugins tab

4. Activate the Sphere Related Content Widget plugin.  (Click Activate in the right column).

   Now, the Sphere link will be inserted at the bottom of all posts longer than 30 words.
   For most blogs, this works just peachy and you're done.  If you're an advanced user 
   and want to customize the behavior and look/placement of the link, read on.
 
5. The default behavior is to place the Sphere link automatically within a <span> tag
   at the end of posts that have more than a minimum length.  You can modify the plugin's
   sphere-related-content.php file to change that behavior.  There are instructions in that file,
   but here are the basics:

   If you NEVER want Sphere links inserted automatically, or if you want to decide where to place
   the link, rather than having it appended to your posts automatically, then set $auto_sphereit to
   FALSE below and follow the instructions in the readme to customize the look and placement of the link.

   If you want Sphere links inserted into ALL of your posts, then set $sphereit_threshold to FALSE below.

   You can always force a Sphere link to be inserted by including `<!--sphereit-->` in the text of a post.

   You can force a Sphere link NOT to be inserted by including `<!--nosphereit-->` in the text of your post.
 
   If you're not sure what to do, leave the settings below at their default value.

6. You can always force a Sphere link to be inserted into a post by putting
   `<!--sphereit-->` anywhere into the post's text.  That comment will not be displayed, but will force
   a Sphere link to be inserted for that post.

7. Conversely, You can keep a Sphere link from being inserted in a post by adding 
   `<!--nosphereit-->` to that post.  Again, this marker will not be displayed, but will prevent 
   a Sphere link from being shown for that post.

8. If you want to override the default placement of the link, you should:

   i) Turn off $auto_sphereit by setting 

         `$auto_sphereit = FALSE;`

      in sphere-related-content.php (search for auto_sphereit to find that line).

   ii) Put this tag anywhere with in a post context (either in your index, archive or single post templates):

	  `<?= get_sphereit_link( get_permalink(), $post->post_content ) ?>`

       If you want to wrap a block-level element around the Sphere link you can do something like this:

	  `<?= (enableSphereItLink($post->post_content) ? '<p class="sphere">'.get_sphereit_link(get_permalink(), $post->post_content).'</p>' : '') ?>`

       The enableSphereItLink() check makes sure that your <p> tags are only gong to show up if the Sphere link is turned on 
       for that post, as decided by the length of your post or your overrides.

       If you're doing your own block-level element like this, you'll want to define stules for in your CSS template, e.g.

	`
	  .sphere {
	     padding: 10px;
	     margin: 10px;
	     border-left: 2px solid red;
	   }	
	`

       Note these styles are an example only, you can go crazy with the styles and make it look just so in your blog.

       That's it, you're ready to discover Sphere Related Content.  Automatically.
